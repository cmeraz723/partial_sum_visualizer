# Partial Sum Visualizer

An interactive applet built with Streamlit to visualize the partial sums of a given series. This tool allows users to select from predefined series or input their own formulas to observe potential convergence or divergence.

## Features

- Visualize partial sums of various series.
- Choose from predefined series types: `1/n`, `1/n^2`, `(-1)^n / n`.
- Input custom formulas for the nth term of a series.
- Observe the behavior of series through interactive plots.

## Input Instructions

When entering custom formulas, use the following syntax for mathematical functions:

- `sin(x)` for $\sin(x)$
- `cos(x)` for $\cos(x)$
- `tan(x)` for $\tan(x)$
- `atan(x)` for $\arctan(x)$
- `exp(x)` for $e^x$
- `log(x)` for $\ln(x)$
- `sqrt(x)` for $\sqrt{x}$
