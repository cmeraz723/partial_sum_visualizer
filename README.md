# Partial Sum Visualizer

An interactive applet built with Streamlit to visualize the partial sums of a given series. This tool allows users to select from predefined series or input their own formulas to observe potential convergence or divergence.

## Features

- Visualize partial sums of various series.
- Choose from predefined series types: `1/n`, `1/n^2`, `(-1)^n / n`.
- Input custom formulas for the nth term of a series.
- Observe the behavior of series through interactive plots.

## Input Instructions

When entering custom formulas, use the following syntax for mathematical functions:

- `sin(n)` for $\sin(n)$
- `cos(n)` for $\cos(n)$
- `tan(n)` for $\tan(n)$
- `atan(n)` for $\arctan(n)$
- `exp(n)` for $e^n$
- `log(n)` for $\ln(n)$
- `sqrt(n)` for $\sqrt{n}$
